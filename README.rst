Setup Development Environment
-----------------------------

    mkdir beedelphi
    cd beedelphi
    python3 -m venv venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install briefcase

Next step - fork BeeDelphi repo to your account on GitHub. And clone it to the local directory.
For me it look like:

    git clone git@github.com:vsergeyev/BeeDelphi.git

Let check if everything is correct, and run app in dev  mode:

    cd beedelphi
    briefcase dev

Have fun!
